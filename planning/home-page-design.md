## 1. First Interview

<!--
  Take a few minutes getting to know your partner and their ambitions. Ask questions about:
  - Their background (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Their ambitions (Professional, programming, personal)
  - Outside interests (For tying into a personal statement)
  - And much more ... listen to your partner and ask questions about what they tell you.
  The best way to do your interview is with a lot of `why?`. Start your interview with one or two open-ended questions and follow up with a lot of `why?`, this gives your partner the chance to really explain themselves instead of just answering your questions. You might find that they even learn something about themselves!

### Summary

<!-- Consolidate your notes into a few sentences. Do your best to express what your partner was trying to say, not what you learned from them. -->

## 2. Follow-Up Interview

<!--
  In this follow up interview you will present to your partner a summary of your first interview. You will do your best effort to understand, rephrase, and communicate your partners needs back to them. Take this chance to listen for their feedback on how well you understand their situation. Update your notes accordingly
-->

### Notes2

- Hans seems to be happy with my understanding and approach to what he wants/needs
 for his homepage project.

- Now the biggest challenge lies ahead and that's the visual part of it. Hans
  likes clean and clear websites with not too many colors.

- He also wants something clear and to the point that can also be representative
 of his personal journey and interests.

### Summary2

- It might be important to think of a way to display all the information in a
 synthetic way that does not make the site look too full.

---

## 3. Capture Findings

<!-- Take some time to consolidate & summarize what you learned in the previous two interviews. -->

### Needs

<!-- What exactly does your partner need from their home page? Are they looking for collaborators? A job?Learning opportunities? Or something you never expected? -->

- Display the main info about the following:

  - Work experience.

  - Studies.

  - Skills related to technology.

  - Portfolio.

  - Personal story and main characteristics.

- Display the info in a fluent way.

- Make the website personable.

### Insights

<!-- New learnings about your partner to use in your design -->

- Hans loves science. He studied math as a major and computer science on the side.

- Working remotely for a Belgian company could make his life way easier since
  he is now working for a company in a different country and time zone.

---

## 4. Define the Problem

<!--
  In your own words describe:
  - Why does your partner need this home page?
  - How do they want to be represented?
  - Who do they want to visit their page?
  - What do they want different visitors to see them?
  A useful format:
  - _partner's name_ needs a way to _?_.
    - Unexpectedly, in their world, _?_.
-->

As mentioned before, finding a job in Belgium, where he currently lives, would
make his life easier in general, but it would also create more opportunities by
giving Hans the chance to keep learning and exploring his passion: the tech-world.

He wants to be represented as an ambitious and hard-working person who enjoys
learning and discovering new things.

He wants to attract mostly recruiters and employers who believe in his potential
to grow and current skill-set.

Hans needs to convey a powerful message about his personality and experience
that represents his potential and desire to work.

## 5. Open-Ended Ideation

<!--
  Sketch up a few wireframes for your partner's home page with no regard for their programming ability, time constraints, technical constraints, or any other practical considerations.
  How are the designs different? How does each one serve your partner differently?
