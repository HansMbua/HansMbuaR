# Hans' Home Page

## Description

I am developer with a broad spectrum of interests that revolve around technology
in general and development in particular. In this project I want to showcase not
only those interests and the experience that I have gained over the past years
thanks to that, but also the path I have followed.

Technology is at the core of what do and what I like. I will try to portray that
the best way possible.

To do so, I will focus for now on HTML and CSS, giving my frontend skills the
chance to speak for me. However, I would love to add some nice JavaScript
features in the future to make my page a bit more dynamic.

## Contribution

Open to contributions. PR's are welcome if they change visuals or add some
feature that helps display the content in a better way.
